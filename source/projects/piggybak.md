description: Modular, Extensible open-source ecommerce solution for Ruby on Rails.
---

Piggybak is a Ruby on Rails Engine with basic shopping cart and one page checkout functionality. It uses RailsAdmin to provide an admin interface to work with orders, products, shipping methods, payment methods, and tax methods. It is not a turn-key ecommerce solution, but is intended to be mounted on existing Rails applications. Piggybak is open-source and free to use.
